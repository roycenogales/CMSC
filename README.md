Purpose: To do matrix operations.
Files: hw8.cpp (this is the main file which includes all of the functions for the matrix operations as well as being the driver), makefile (this file creates the hw8.o and hw8 files, and can run the file).
Build Instructions: N/A
Testing Methodology: I would test incrementally throughout the coding process to check each function for errors, so that I would not have to test at the end and backtrack to find errors.
Additional Information: N/A
